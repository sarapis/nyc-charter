        §  8.  General  powers.  The  mayor,  subject  to  this charter, shall
      exercise all the powers vested in the city, except as otherwise provided
      by law.
        a. The mayor shall be responsible for the effectiveness and  integrity
      of  city  government  operations  and  shall establish and maintain such
      policies and procedures as are necessary and appropriate  to  accomplish
      this responsibility including the implementation of effective systems of
      internal  control  by each agency and unit under the jurisdiction of the
      mayor.
        b. The mayor shall be a magistrate.
        c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the  mayor  shall  have
      the  powers  of  a  finance  board  under  the local finance law and may
      exercise such powers without regard to any provision of law  prescribing
      the  voting strength required for a resolution or action of such finance
      board, provided,  however,  that  whenever  the  mayor  determines  that
      obligations  should  be  issued and the amount thereof, he shall certify
      such determination to the comptroller who shall thereupon determine  the
      nature  and  term of such obligations and shall arrange for the issuance
      thereof.
        d. The mayor shall establish  a  minimum  per  diem  compensation  for
      inspectors  of  election and clerks employed to assist the inspectors of
      election in polling places under the direction of the board of elections
      as follows: on registration and primary election days twenty dollars; on
      Election day thirty-five dollars,  except  that  the  chairman  of  each
      election  board  shall  receive an additional three dollars compensation
      per day. The  minimum  per  diem  rate  for  compensation  for  election
      inspectors attending classes of instruction shall be five dollars.
        e. The mayor shall establish a professional internal audit function in
      the  executive  office  of  the mayor which is sufficient to provide the
      mayor with such information and assurances as the mayor,  as  the  chief
      executive  of  the city, requires to ensure the proper administration of
      the city's affairs and the efficient conduct of its business.
        f. Except as otherwise provided in section eleven, the mayor  may,  by
      executive  order,  at  any time, create or abolish bureaus, divisions or
      positions within the executive office of the mayor as he or she may deem
      necessary to fulfill mayoral duties. The mayor may from time to time  by
      executive order, delegate to or withdraw from any member of said office,
      specified  functions, powers and duties, except the mayor's power to act
      on local laws or resolutions of the council, to act as a  magistrate  or
      to appoint or remove officials. Every such order shall be filed with the
      city  clerk  who  shall  forward  them  forthwith to the City Record for
      publication.
        g. The city has the power to determine the duties  of  its  employees,
      and  it  is  essential  to the workings of city government that the city
      retain control over information obtained by city employees in the course
      of their duties. In the exercise of this power, the mayor may promulgate
      rules requiring that information obtained  by  city  employees  be  kept
      confidential   to   the  extent  necessary  to  preserve  the  trust  of
      individuals who have business with city  agencies.  To  the  extent  set
      forth  in such rules, each agency shall, to the fullest extent permitted
      by the laws of the United States and the state of New York, maintain the
      confidentiality  of  information  in  its  possession  relating  to  the
      immigration  status or other private information that was provided by an
      individual to a city employee in the course of such employee's duties.

Section 10.
-----------

Section 10. ::    
        
     
        §  10.  Succession.  a.  In  case  of the suspension of the mayor from
      office, the mayor's temporary inability  to  discharge  the  powers  and
      duties of the office of mayor by reason of sickness or otherwise, or the
      mayor's  absence  from  the city, the powers and duties of the office of
      mayor shall devolve upon the public advocate or the comptroller in  that
      order  of  succession  until  the suspension, inability or absence shall
      cease.  While so acting temporarily as mayor neither the public advocate
      nor the comptroller shall  exercise  any  power  of  appointment  to  or
      removal  from  office  or any power lawfully delegated by the mayor to a
      deputy mayor before the commencement of such suspension or inability, or
      before or after the commencement of such absence; and shall  not,  until
      such  suspension,  inability  or absence shall have continued nine days,
      sign, approve or disapprove any local  law  or  resolution,  unless  the
      period  during  which the mayor can act thereon would expire during said
      nine days in which case the public advocate  or  the  comptroller  shall
      have  the  power  to disapprove the same within forty-eight hours before
      the time to act expires.
        b. In the case of a failure of a person elected as mayor  to  qualify,
      or  a  vacancy in the office caused by the mayor's resignation, removal,
      death or permanent inability to discharge the powers and duties  of  the
      office  of  mayor,  such powers and duties shall devolve upon the public
      advocate, the comptroller or a person selected pursuant to subdivision c
      of section twenty-eight, in that order of succession, until a new  mayor
      shall  be  elected as provided herein. Upon the commencement of the term
      of the  person  first  elected  mayor  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      subdivision  c of this section, the person then acting as mayor pursuant
      to the provisions of this subdivision, if  an  elected  official,  shall
      complete  the term of the office to which such person was elected if any
      remains.
        c. 1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in  the  office
      of the mayor, the person acting as mayor shall proclaim the date for the
      election  or  elections  required by this subdivision, provide notice of
      such proclamation to the city clerk  and  the  board  of  elections  and
      publish notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation of the
      date  for  an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of
      this subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof  not  less
      than  twice  in  each  week  preceding  the  date  of  such  election in
      newspapers distributed within the city, and the board of elections shall
      mail notice of such election to all registered voters within the city.
        2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years  of  the  term,  a
      general  election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired
      term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs,  unless  the
      vacancy  occurs  after  the last day on which an occuring vacancy may be
      filled at the general election in that same year with party  nominations
      of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary election, as
      provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy  occurs
      in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of
      the  unexpired  term  at  the  general  election  in  the following year
      provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy  shall  be
      held  in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine
      of this subdivision. Party  nominations  of  candidates  for  a  general
      election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall
      be  made  at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of
      this subdivision.
        3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an  interim
      basis  has  not  been  previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six,
      seven and eight of this subdivision, the  person  elected  to  fill  the
      vacancy  for  the  remainder of the unexpired term at a general election
    
      shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall  serve  until
      the  term  expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy
      on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
      the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general
      election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
      general election and shall serve until the term expires.
        4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on
      or  before  the  last  day  in  the  third  year of the term on which an
      occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
      at  a  general  election  with  party nominations of candidates for such
      election being made at a primary election, as provided in section  6-116
      of  the  election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy
      on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs  less  than
      ninety  days before the next primary election at which party nominations
      for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or  before
      the  last  day  on  which  an  occurring  vacancy  may be filled for the
      remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year
      in which the vacancy occurs with party  nominations  of  candidates  for
      such  election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section
      6-116 of the election law.
        5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the  third  year  of  the
      term  on  which  an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of
      the unexpired term at  a  general  election  in  each  year  with  party
      nominations  of candidates for such election are being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less
      than ninety days before the date of the primary election in  the  fourth
      year  of  such  term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy
      for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held.
        6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
      subdivision  shall  be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner: a special
      election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
      sixty days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the person
      acting as mayor, in the proclamation required by paragraph one  of  this
      subdivision,  may  schedule  such election for another day not more than
      ten days after such Tuesday and not less  than  forty  days  after  such
      proclamation  if  the  person  acting  as  mayor  determines  that  such
      rescheduling is necessary to  facilitate  maximum  voter  participation;
      except that
        (a)  if  the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and
      the first Tuesday at least  sixty  days  after  the  occurrence  of  the
      vacancy  is  less  than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general
      election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy  shall
      be filled at such general election; and
        (b)  if  the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and
      the first Tuesday at least  sixty  days  after  the  occurrence  of  the
      vacancy  is  after  a  regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy
      shall be filled at such general election; and
        (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any  year
      and  the  first  Tuesday at least sixty days after the occurrence of the
      vacancy is after, but less than thirty days after, a regularly scheduled
      general election, the vacancy shall be filled at a special  election  to
      be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
        7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
      paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
      nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
      made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
      of this subdivision shall not be counted.
    
        8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the mayor at an
      election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall  take
      office   immediately   upon   qualification  and  serve  until  December
      thirty-first of the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled  for  the
      remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  pursuant  to  paragraph two of this
      subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in  the  office  of  the
      mayor at an election held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision
      shall  take  office  immediately  upon qualification and serve until the
      term expires.
        9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
      primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
      general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
      office immediately upon qualification  and  fill  the  vacancy  for  the
      remainder of the unexpired term.
        10.  If  at  any  election held pursuant to this subdivision for which
      nominations were made by independent nominating petitions, no  candidate
      receives forty percent or more of the vote, the two candidates receiving
      the most votes shall advance to a runoff election which shall be held on
      the  second  Tuesday next succeeding the date on which such election was
      held.
        d. Determination of mayoral inability.
        1. Voluntary declaration of temporary inability.  Whenever  the  mayor
      transmits  to  the  official  next in line of succession and to the city
      clerk, a written declaration that he or she  is  temporarily  unable  to
      discharge  the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such powers and
      duties shall devolve upon the  official  next  in  line  of  succession,
      subject  to  the provisions of subdivision a of this section. Thereafter
      if the mayor transmits to the acting mayor  and  to  the  city  clerk  a
      written  declaration  that  he or she is able to resume the discharge of
      the powers and duties of the office of mayor, the mayor shall resume the
      discharge of such powers and duties immediately upon the receipt of such
      declaration by the city clerk.
        2. Inability committee. (a) There shall  be  a  committee  on  mayoral
      inability  consisting  of: the corporation counsel, the comptroller, the
      speaker of the council, a deputy mayor who shall be  designated  by  the
      mayor, and the borough president with the longest consecutive service as
      borough  president. If two or more borough presidents have served for an
      equal length of time, one of such borough presidents shall  be  selected
      by  lot  to  be  a  member of such committee. If at any time there is no
      valid mayoral designation in force, the deputy mayor  with  the  longest
      consecutive  service  as  a  deputy  mayor  shall  be  a  member of such
      committee. The authority to act as a member of such committee shall  not
      be delegable.
        (b) Such committee by affirmative declaration of no fewer than four of
      its  members  shall have the power to make the declarations described in
      paragraphs four and five of this subdivision. No such declaration  shall
      be effective unless signed by all the members making it.
        3.  Panel  on mayoral inability. (a) There shall be a panel on mayoral
      inability. Unless otherwise provided by  state  law,  such  panel  shall
      consist of all the members of the council.
        (b)  The  panel  shall  have  the  power  to  make  the determinations
      described in paragraphs four and five of this subdivision.
        4.  Temporary  inability.  (a)  Whenever  the  committee  on   mayoral
      inability  personally  serves or causes to be personally served upon the
      mayor and transmits to the official next  in  line  of  succession,  the
      members  of  the  panel  on  mayoral  inability  and the city clerk, its
      written declaration that the mayor is temporarily  unable  to  discharge
      the  powers and duties of the office of mayor, together with a statement
    
      of its reasons for such declaration, such declaration shall constitute a
      determination  of  temporary  inability   unless   the   mayor,   within
      forty-eight  hours  after  receipt of such declaration, transmits to the
      official  next  in  line  of succession, the members of the committee on
      mayoral inability, the members of the panel on mayoral inability and the
      city clerk, a written declaration that he or she is  able  to  discharge
      the powers and duties of the office of mayor, together with responses to
      the  statement  by the committee on mayoral inability of its reasons for
      its declaration.
        (b) If personal service of the committee's declaration upon the  mayor
      cannot be accomplished, or if such service has been accomplished but the
      mayor  has  not  transmitted  a  declaration  that  he or she is able to
      discharge  the  powers  and  duties  of  the  office  of  mayor   within
      forty-eight  hours  after  receipt  of such declaration, such powers and
      duties shall devolve upon the  official  next  in  line  of  succession,
      subject  to  the provisions of subdivision a of this section, unless and
      until the mayor resumes the authority to discharge such powers  pursuant
      to the provisions of subparagraphs (e) or (f) of this paragraph.
        (c)   If   within  such  forty-eight  hours,  the  mayor  transmits  a
      declaration that he or she is able to discharge the powers and duties of
      the office of mayor, such powers and duties shall not devolve  upon  the
      official  next  in  line  of  succession and the mayor shall continue to
      discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, unless and until
      the panel on mayoral inability, within twenty-one days after its receipt
      of the mayor's declaration, determines by two-thirds  vote  of  all  its
      members that the mayor is temporarily unable to discharge the powers and
      duties of the office of mayor. If the panel determines that the mayor is
      unable  to  discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor, such
      powers and duties shall devolve  upon  the  official  next  in  line  of
      succession,  subject to the provisions of subdivision a of this section,
      unless and until the mayor  resumes  the  authority  to  discharge  such
      powers and duties pursuant to the provisions of subparagraphs (e) or (f)
      of this paragraph.
        (d)  If,  at  any  time  prior  to  a final determination by the panel
      pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this paragraph  the  mayor  transmits  a
      voluntary  declaration of temporary inability pursuant to the provisions
      of paragraph one of this subdivision, to the official next  in  line  of
      succession,  the  members  of  the  committee  on mayoral inability, the
      members of the panel on mayoral inability, and the city clerk, then  the
      procedures  set  forth  in  paragraph  one  of this subdivision shall be
      followed.
        (e) If a determination of temporary inability has been  made  pursuant
      to  the provisions of subparagraphs (a) or (c) of this paragraph, and if
      thereafter, the mayor transmits to the acting mayor, the members of  the
      committee  on  mayoral  inability,  the  members of the panel on mayoral
      inability and the city clerk, a written declaration that he  or  she  is
      able  to  resume the discharge of the powers and duties of the office of
      mayor, then the mayor shall resume the  discharge  of  such  powers  and
      duties  four  days  after  the  receipt  of such declaration by the city
      clerk, unless the committee on mayoral inability, within such four days,
      personally serves or causes to be personally served upon the  mayor  and
      transmits  to  the  acting  mayor,  the  members of the panel on mayoral
      inability and the city clerk, its written  declaration  that  the  mayor
      remains  unable  to  discharge  the  powers  and duties of the office of
      mayor.
        (f) If the committee transmits a declaration that  the  mayor  remains
      unable  to  discharge  the powers and duties of the office of mayor, the
      mayor shall not resume the discharge of the powers  and  duties  of  the
    
      office  of mayor unless and until the panel on mayoral inability, within
      twenty-one days of  its  receipt  of  such  declaration,  determines  by
      two-thirds  vote  of  all  its  members  that  the inability has in fact
      ceased.  Upon such a determination by the panel, or after the expiration
      of twenty-one days, if the panel has not acted, the mayor  shall  resume
      the discharge of the powers and duties of the office of mayor.
        5.   Permanent  inability.  (a)  Whenever  the  committee  on  mayoral
      inability personally serves or causes to be personally served  upon  the
      mayor  and  transmits  to  the  official next in line of succession, the
      members of the panel on  mayoral  inability  and  the  city  clerk,  its
      declaration that the mayor is permanently unable to discharge the powers
      and  duties  of  the office of mayor, together with its reasons for such
      declaration, the panel on mayoral  inability  shall,  within  twenty-one
      days after its receipt of such declaration, determine whether or not the
      mayor  is  permanently  unable to discharge the powers and duties of the
      office of mayor.
        (b) If the panel determines by two-thirds vote of all its members that
      the mayor is permanently unable to discharge the powers  and  duties  of
      the  office  of  mayor,  such  powers  and duties shall devolve upon the
      official next  in  line  of  succession  as  acting  mayor  pursuant  to
      subdivision  b  of this section, and the office of mayor shall be deemed
      vacant.
        6. Continuation of salary; disability allowance. (a) During  the  time
      that  any  official  is  acting  as mayor pursuant to a determination of
      temporary inability, the mayor shall continue to be paid the  salary  of
      the  office of mayor, and the acting mayor shall continue to be paid the
      salary of the office to which such person was elected.

      and implement a plan to distribute the bill of rights  to  all  relevant
      business  owners,  including via electronic publication on the internet,
      and to notify such business owners if the bill of rights is subsequently
      updated or revised. The office of  operations  shall  also  develop  and
      implement a plan in cooperation with all relevant agencies to facilitate
      distribution of a physical copy of the bill of rights to business owners
      or  managers at the time of an inspection, except that if the inspection
      is an undercover inspection or if the business owner or manager  is  not
    
      present at the time of the inspection, then a copy of the bill of rights
      shall be provided as soon as practicable.
        3.  The  bill  of rights shall serve as an informational document only
      and nothing in this subdivision or in such document shall  be  construed

      of rights. The bill of  rights  shall  be  in  the  form  of  a  written
      document,  drafted  in  plain  language, that advises business owners of
      their rights as they relate to agency inspections. The  bill  of  rights
      shall  include,  but not be limited to, notice of every business owner's
      right to: i) consistent enforcement of agency rules; ii)  compliment  or

      implement a plan in cooperation with all relevant agencies to facilitate
      distribution of a physical copy of the bill of rights to business owners
      or  managers at the time of an inspection, except that if the inspection

      and implement a plan for each business owner to indicate the language in
      which such owner would prefer that agency inspections of the business be
      conducted. To the extent practicable, the  office  of  operations  shall
      also  develop  and  implement  a plan to inform all relevant agencies of
      such respective language preference.
        4. The bill of rights shall serve as an  informational  document  only
      and  nothing  in this subdivision or in such document shall be construed
      so as to create a cause of action or constitute a defense in any  legal,
      administrative, or other proceeding.
        * NB Effective April 16, 2014
        g.  1.  The office of operations shall develop a standardized customer
      service training curriculum to be used, to the  extent  practicable,  by
      relevant  agencies  for  training agency inspectors. Such training shall
      include  instruction  on  communicating  effectively  with   non-English

      consumer  affairs,  the  department  of  health  and mental hygiene, the
      department of environmental protection, the  department  of  sanitation,

      subdivision.  After  completing  such  review,  the office of operations
      shall certify an agency's inspector training program if it includes,  to
      the  extent  practicable,  the  standardized  customer  service training
      curriculum developed by the office of operations pursuant  to  paragraph
      one of this subdivision. Any such certification shall be provided to the
      speaker of the council upon request.

Section 18. ::    
        
     
        § 18. Office of immigrant affairs. a. The city recognizes that a large
      percentage  of  its  inhabitants were born abroad or are the children of
      parents who were born abroad and that the well-being and safety  of  the
      city  is  put  in jeopardy if the people of the city do not seek medical
      treatment for illnesses that may be contagious, do  not  cooperate  with
      the  police when they witness a crime or do not avail themselves of city
      services to educate themselves  and  their  children.  It  is  therefore
      desirable  that the city promote the utilization of city services by all
      its residents, including foreign-born inhabitants, speakers  of  foreign
      languages and undocumented aliens.
        b.  In  furtherance  of  the  policies stated in subdivision a of this
      section, there shall be established in the executive office of the mayor
      an office of  immigrant  affairs.  The  office  shall  be  headed  by  a
      director,  who  shall  be  appointed  by  the mayor. The director of the
      office of immigrant affairs shall have the power and the duty to:
        1. advise and assist the mayor  and  the  council  in  developing  and
      implementing   policies   designed   to   assist  immigrants  and  other
      foreign-language speakers in the city;
        2. enhance the  accessibility  of  city  services  to  immigrants  and
      foreign-language speakers by establishing programs to inform and educate
      immigrant and foreign language speakers of such services;
        3.   manage  a  citywide  list  of  translators  and  interpreters  to
      facilitate communication between  city  agencies  and  foreign  language
      speakers;
        4.   perform  policy  analysis  and  make  recommendations  concerning
      immigrant affairs; and
        5. perform such other duties and functions as may  be  appropriate  to
      pursue the policies set forth in subdivision a of this section.
        c.  Any  service  provided by a city agency shall be made available to
      all aliens who are otherwise eligible  for  such  service  to  the  same
      extent  such service is made available to citizens unless such agency is
      required by law to deny eligibility for such service to aliens.

        §  19.  Office  to  combat  domestic violence. a. The city of New York
      recognizes  that  domestic  violence  is  a  public  health  issue  that
      threatens  hundreds  of  thousands  of  households  each  year  and that
      respects  no  boundaries  of  race,  ethnicity,  age,   gender,   sexual
      orientation  or economic status. The city of New York further recognizes
      that  the  problems  posed  by  domestic  violence   fall   within   the
      jurisdiction  and  programs  of  various  City  agencies  and  that  the
      development of  an  integrated  approach  to  the  problem  of  domestic
      violence,  which  coordinates existing services and systems, is critical
      to the success of the city of New York's efforts in this area.
        b. There shall be, in the executive office of the mayor, an office  to
      combat  domestic violence. The office shall be headed by a director, who
      shall be appointed by the mayor.
        c. The director of the office to combat domestic violence  shall  have
      the power and duty to:
        1. coordinate domestic violence services;
        2. formulate policies and programs relating to all aspects of services
      and protocols for victims of domestic violence;
        3. develop methods to improve the coordination of systems and services
      for domestic violence;
        4.  develop  and  maintain  mechanisms to improve the response of city
      agencies to domestic violence situations and improve coordination  among
      such agencies; and
        5.  implement  public  education  campaigns  to  heighten awareness of
      domestic violence and its effects on  society  and  perform  such  other
      functions as may be appropriate regarding the problems posed by domestic
      violence.
        d. 1. For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms shall have
      the following meanings:
        (i)  "Agency"  shall  mean  a  city, county, borough, or other office,
      position,  administration,  department,  division,  bureau,   board   or
      commission,  or  a corporation, institution or agency of government, the
      expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.
        (ii) "Domestic violence fatality" shall mean a death of  a  family  or
      household member, resulting from an act or acts of violence committed by
      another family or household member, not including acts of self-defense.
        (iii)   "Family   or   household  member"  shall  mean  the  following
      individuals:
        (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;

      persons have been married or have lived together at any time;
        (e)  persons  not  legally married, but currently living together in a
      family-type relationship; and
        (f) persons not legally married, but who have formerly lived  together
      in a family-type relationship.
        Such term, as described in (e) and (f) of this subparagraph, therefore
      includes  "common  law" marriages, same sex couples, registered domestic

      constitutes a domestic violence fatality.
    
        2. There shall be a domestic violence  fatality  review  committee  to

      in the city of New York. Such committee  shall  develop  recommendations
      for  the  consideration of the director of the office to combat domestic
      violence  regarding  the  coordination  and  improvement of services for
      victims  of  domestic  violence  provided  by   agencies   and   private
      organizations  that provide such services pursuant to a contract with an
      agency. The committee shall be convened by the director of the office to
      combat domestic violence, or his or her designee, and shall  consist  of

      services, or his or her designee. The committee shall  also  consist  of
      two representatives of programs that provide social or legal services to
      victims   of   domestic  violence  and  two  individuals  with  personal
      experience with domestic violence. The director of the office to  combat
      domestic violence, or his or her designee, shall serve as chairperson of
      the committee. At the discretion of the director of the office to combat
      domestic  violence,  the  committee may also include a representative of
      any of the offices of the district attorney of any of the five  boroughs
      and/or  a  representative  of  the New York city housing authority. Each
      member of the committee other than any member serving in an  ex  officio
      capacity shall be appointed by the mayor.
        (i)  The  service  of each member other than a member serving in an ex
      officio capacity shall be for a term of two  years  to  commence  ninety
      days  after  the  effective  date  of  the  local  law  that  added this
      subdivision. Any vacancy occurring other  than  by  expiration  of  term
      shall be filled by the mayor in the same manner as the original position
      was  filled.  A  person  filling  such  a  vacancy  shall  serve for the
      unexpired portion of the term of the member succeeded. New  terms  shall
      begin on the next day after the expiration date of the preceding term.
        (ii) Members of the committee shall serve without compensation.
        (iii)  No  person  shall be ineligible for membership on the committee
      because such person holds any other public office, employment or  trust,
      nor  shall  any  person  be  made ineligible to or forfeit such person's
      right to any public office,  employment  or  trust  by  reason  of  such
      appointment.
        (iv) The committee shall meet at least four times a year.
        3.  The  committee's  work  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to,
      reviewing statistical data relating  to  domestic  violence  fatalities;
      analyzing   aggregate   information   relating   to   domestic  violence
      fatalities, including, non-identifying data with respect to victims  and
      perpetrators  involved  in domestic violence fatalities, such as gender,
      age,  race  and  familial  or  other  relationship  involved,  and,   if
      available,  religion,  ethnicity  and  employment  status; examining any
      factors indicating a  high-risk  of  involvement  in  domestic  violence
      fatalities;  and  developing  recommendations  for  the  director of the
      mayor's office to combat domestic violence  regarding  the  coordination
      and improvement of services for victims of domestic violence provided by
      agencies  and  private organizations that provide such services pursuant
      to a contract with an agency.
        4. The committee may request and receive information from  any  agency
      as  may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision, in
      accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,  including,  but
    
      not limited to, the exceptions to disclosure of agency records contained
      in  the  public  officers  law.  Nothing  in  this  subdivision shall be
      construed as limiting any right or obligation of  agencies  pursuant  to
      the  public  officers  law,  including  the  exceptions to disclosure of
      agency records contained in such law,  with  respect  to  access  to  or
      disclosure  of  records  or  portions  thereof.  The  committee may also
      request from any private organization  providing  services  to  domestic
      violence  victims  pursuant  to  a  contract  with an agency information
      necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision. To the extent
      provided by  law,  the  committee  shall  protect  the  privacy  of  all
      individuals   involved  in  any  domestic  violence  fatality  that  the
      committee may receive information on in carrying out the  provisions  of
      this subdivision.
        5.  The  committee shall submit to the mayor and to the speaker of the
      city council, on an annual basis, a report including,  but  not  limited

      city  of  New  York  during  the  previous  year; the number of domestic
      violence fatality cases reviewed by the committee  during  the  previous
      year,  if  any;  any  non-identifying  data  with respect to victims and
      perpetrators involved in domestic violence fatalities, such  as  gender,
      age,   race  and  familial  or  other  relationship  involved,  and,  if
      available,  religion,  ethnicity  and  employment  status;  any  factors
      indicating  a  high risk of involvement in domestic violence fatalities;
      and  recommendations  regarding  the  coordination  and  improvement  of
      services  for  victims  of  domestic  violence  provided by agencies and
      private organizations that provide such services pursuant to a  contract
      with an agency.

      categories established by the director, and a list of policies, programs
      and actions that the city will seek to implement or undertake to achieve
      each goal by no later than April twenty-second, two thousand thirty.
        2.  No  later  than  April  twenty-second, two thousand eleven, and no

      long-term sustainability plan, setting forth goals associated with  each
      category  established pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of this
      section and any additional categories established by the director, and a
      list of policies, programs and  actions  that  the  city  will  seek  to
      implement  or  undertake  to  achieve  each goal by no later than twenty

      communities. Such updated plan shall take into  account  the  population
      projections  required  pursuant  to  subdivision  d  of this section. An

      plan.  Where  any  categories, goals, policies, programs or actions have
      been revised in, added to or deleted from an updated plan, or where  any
      milestone  has been revised in or deleted from an updated plan, the plan
      shall include the reason for such addition, revision  or  deletion.  The
      director  shall  seek  public  input  regarding  an updated plan and its
      implementation before developing and submitting such  plan  pursuant  to
      this  paragraph.  The director shall coordinate the implementation of an
      updated long-term sustainability plan.

      sustainability  efforts.  In  those  years  when  an  updated  long-term
      sustainability   plan   is   submitted  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of
      subdivision e of this section, such report may be incorporated into  the
      updated  long-term  sustainability  plan. The report shall include, at a
